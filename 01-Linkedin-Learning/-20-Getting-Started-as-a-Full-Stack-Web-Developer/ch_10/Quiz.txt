1- According to this video, what's the best way to get to know the people who create an open-source technology?

- Answer: Help to create the technology.
By contributing to an open-source project, you get to know both the technology and the people who create it.

2- You copied and pasted some code into your program without any changes; it doesn't work. What's a likely reason?

- Answer: Your program uses different variable names from the copied code.
Whenever you copy code, you have to adapt it to your program, including the variable names.

3- Why shouldn't your first post in a technology forum be, "May I ask a question?"

- Answer: Developers see this question as a waste of time.
Developers' time is scarce (and expensive!): They tend to prefer you get right to the point.
