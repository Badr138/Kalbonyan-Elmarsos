1- What is NOT a way to use version control?

- Answer: making changes to an image file and saving the new version to the same file
Without saving previous versions of the file separately, no changes are tracked.

2- How might users make use of Git's version control capabilities?

- Answer: A development team can use Git to evaluate version differences before prior to new changes into the production code base.
Git's strengths lie in its ability to allow multiple users to contribute to a repository, and the repo owner can easily evaluate proposed changes with Git's tools.

3- Why is Git so much more powerful than earlier version control systems?

- Answer: It is fast, can handle large code bases, and is distributed.
Torvalds needed Git to work well for Linux, so it needed to be fast, handle the entire kernel base, and be accessible to the open source community.

4- What is the effect if a file in the main repository becomes corrupted?

- Answer: There is no effect on users' local copies.
Because Git is distributed, the file in users' repositories will be unaffected by any changes to the file in the main repository unless users attempt to retrieve the corrupted file.
