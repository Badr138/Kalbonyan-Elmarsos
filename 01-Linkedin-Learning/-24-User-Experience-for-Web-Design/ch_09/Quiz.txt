1- All of these statements about online forms are true EXCEPT:

- Answer: Forms provide you with a marketing opportunity that you should always take advantage of.
It may be tempting to treat forms as marketing opportunities, but refrain from this temptation. Users will see through this, and will then be less likely to proceed.

2- When is the best time to ask visitors to fill out forms on your site?

- Answer: When they have already demonstrated interest in your products or services.
If visitors are committing to buying from you (downloading a free trial, etc.), this is when a short form can be presented.

3- Evaluate the web form in this image. What is the biggest problem with the form? 

- Answer: It should not contain a 'Reset' button.
The 'Reset' button causes users pain. If anything, a visibly differentiated cancel button should be used and spaced from 'Submit'.

4- How should error messages be handled when users fill in forms?

- Answer: catch the error and display it in-line with the field that needs attention
This is the best practice, and fields needing attention are usually highlighted in red with an inline error message.

5- Your website's forms use the style shown in this image, with form labels and form fields left-aligned. How could this form style be improved for readability? 

- Answer: right-align the form fields, and right-align the text
Right-aligning the form fields and labels makes it slightly easier for users to scan between the labels and associated fields.

6- Forms should include all of the following EXCEPT:

- Answer: fields that ask for zip codes so you can provide targeted ads
This should not be one of your primary concerns. It's important to establish a connection with users before asking them to disclose personal information.
