Visitors view this content first, and will read more when they see the page has the information they need.

4- Which statement most accurately describes the inverted pyramid style of writing on the web?

Give readers the conclusion first, so they know they are in the right place and will read until they reach the level of detail needed.

5- You know that the 'About Us' page is your site's least visited page, but it's still important to include in your primary navigation structure. Taking what you know about how people read on the web, where might you place the 'About Us' menu on your homepage?

People tend to focus their attention on the left side of the screen. You should capitalize on this by placing your most important content here. The top-right corner can be used for items of secondary importance.
