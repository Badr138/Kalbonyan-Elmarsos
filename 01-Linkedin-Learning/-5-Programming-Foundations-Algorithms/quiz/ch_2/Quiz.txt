1- What benefit does a linked list provide?

- Answer: underlying memory does not need to be contiguous
The underlying memory that holds any node data does not need to be contiguous for a linked list.

2- What criteria allows algorithms to execute efficiently?

- Answer: the scenario and available data structure types
The efficient use of algorithms depends on the scenario, such as a task list that needs to be sorted and the structure type such as an array.

3- In the example linear array, how are the elements referenced using index values? 

- Answer: 0,1,2,3,4
Elements in an array are referenced by index values, typically starting at 0.

4- Why are hash tables favored over arrays or linked lists?

- Answer: They are faster for item lookups.

5- Why are linked lists sometimes preferred over arrays?

- Answer: They are easier and faster to iterate sequentially.

6- According to the code snippet below, which element will be removed from the queue?
queue.append(1)
queue.append(2)
queue.append(3)
queue.append(4)
x = queue.popleft()

- Answer: 1
A queue uses a first-in, first-out approach. Since element 1 is added first, it is the first to be removed with the pop instruction.

7- Stacks are _____ data structures.

- Answer: last in, first out

8- How does a hash table map index values to data values?

- Answer: Keys are mapped to data values by using a hash to compute an index value.
A hash table is an associative array where a hash function uses a key to compute an index value and to map to the data value.

9- Which data structure is most analogous to a dictionary?

- Answer: a hash table

10- What does the below code do, when working with a linked list?
	1 new_node = Node(data)
	2 new_node.set_next(self.head)
	3 self.head = new_node
	4 self.count += 1

- Answer: It add a new node and makes it the head of the list.
When a new value (node) is inserted in a linked list, the head can point to the new node by using the self.head = new_node code.

11- Which data structure operation would be used for an “undo” command?

- Answer: a stack using last-in, first-out
A stack is useful in providing backtracking features such as an undo button. An undo button would process the last command used as the first to undo.

12- How many elements are in an 8 by 3 by 2 array?

- Answer: 48
