3- Which classifications apply to Euclid's algorithm for finding the least common denominator?

- Answer: exact and deterministic

4- Which algorithm type derives a new set of data from an existing set of data?

- Answer: a computational algorithm
A computational algorithm uses calculations to derive and output new data from another set of input data.

5- The measurement of algorithm performance is dependent on which criteria?

- Answer: the input data
The measurement of performance for an algorithm is dependent on the input data and varies as the input size grows.

6- What is the purpose of an algorithm?

- Answer: to solve a specific problem with a sequential set of steps
