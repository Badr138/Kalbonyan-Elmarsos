1- Describe the CSS relationship between the h2 and button in the diagram shown.

- Answer: general siblings
Since "h2" and "button" are both children of "main", they are siblings. Since they are not immediately next to each other, they are general siblings.

2- For the provided HTML, which items will be selected by the following selectors: div.b ~ div and div.b + div
        <div class="a">a
                <div class="b">b
                        <div class="c">c</div>
                        <div class="d">d</div>
                </div>
                <div class="e">e</div>
                <div class="f">f</div>
        </div>

- Answer: div.b ~ div selects E and F while div.b + div selects only E.
"div.b ~ div" contains the general sibling selector, so both E and F will be selected. "div.b + div" is the adjacent sibling selector, so only E will be selected.

3- Which HTML structure is a match to this selector?
nav.mainnav ul li.active a

- Answer: 
<nav class="mainnav">
        <h2>Navigation</h2>
        <ul>
                <li class="active">
                        <span><a href="#">link</a></span>
                </li>
        </ul>
</nav>
Remember that descendent selectors do not imply a parent-child relationship specifically, although this can occur. It's OK to have additional HTML tags in between some elements of the selector.

4- In this code, create a selector to select the first link, but not the second.
        <ul>
                <li class="active">
                        <a href="#">select me</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                        <a href="#">don't select me</a>
                </li>
        </ul>

- Answer: .active a
This selector selects any "a" element which is descended from any element with a class of "active". This would select the first link, but not the second.

5- Selectors are written from right to left, but they are read from left to right.

- Answer: FALSE
When reading a selector, start from the end and work your way to the beginning, or from right to left. When writing selectors, write them from left to right.

6- Describe the CSS relationship between nav and li in the diagram shown.

- Answer: li is a descendant of nav.
"li" is a descendant of "nav". There are no other existing CSS relationships to describe this style of relationship.

7- In the HTML below, which div elements are adjacent siblings?
        <div class="a">a
                <div class="b">b
                        <div class="c">c</div>
                        <div class="d">d</div>
                </div>
                <div class="e">e</div>
                <div class="f">f</div>
        </div>

- Answer: C and D; B and E; E and F
Adjacent siblings are those immediately next to each other. Siblings may have children of their own. For that reason, B and E are adjacent siblings, but B and F are general siblings. C and D, and E and F, are also siblings.

8- In this code, write a selector to select the second paragraph.
        <aside>
                <h3>Heading</h3>
                <p>A paragraph.</p>
                <div>        
                        <p>Select me.</p>
                </div>
        </aside>

- Answer: div > p
This selector selects any "p" element that is a child of any "div" element.

9- Given the below HTML, what will the selector div > div select?
        <div class="a">a
                <div class="b">b
                        <div class="c">c</div>
                </div>
        </div>

- Answer: div.b and div.c
This selector selects a div child of a div parent. B is a child of A, and C is a child of B. Therefore, "div.b" and "div.c" is the correct answer.
