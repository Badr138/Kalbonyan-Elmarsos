1- What does the :active pseudo-class style?

- Answer: :active styles the link after the link is clicked.
":active" styles the link after it is clicked. This link state is rarely seen with modern internet speeds, but it is still available for styling.

2- The :target pseudo-class is used for styling links that use the target attribute.

- Answer: FALSE
The ":target" pseudo-class may be used for styling in-page navigation.

3- Which selector would select links that do not open in a new window?

- Answer: a:not([target="_blank"])
To select links that open in a new window, use the "target" attribute with a value of "_blank". Placing "a:not" in front of this means we're looking for links that don't have this attribute.

4- Specify as many ways as possible to select item four below.
<ul>
        <li>One</li>
        <li>Two</li>
        <li>Three</li>
        <li>Four</li>
        <li>Five</li>
</ul>

- Answer: 
li:nth-child(4)
li:nth-of-type(4)
li:nth-last-child(2)
li:nth-last-of-type(2)
":nth-of-type", "nth:child", "nth-last-child", and "nth-last-of-type" all apply here. Select the exact item you want by specifying the number from the top or bottom of the list as appropriate.

5- Use a single selector to select the h1, p, div, and footer in this HTML:

- Answer: section > *
"h1", "p", "div", and "footer" are children of the "section" tag. Combining the parent-child and the universal selector will select these elements without selecting their children.

6- Using :nth-child and :nth-of-type, specify as many ways as possible to select every other list item below, starting with the first.
<ul>
        <li>One</li>
        <li>Two</li>
        <li>Three</li>
        <li>Four</li>
        <li>Five</li>
</ul>

- Answer: 
li:nth-child(odd)
li:nth-of-type(odd)
li:nth-child(2n-1)
li:nth-of-type(2n-1)
li:nth-child(2n+1)
li:nth-of-type(2n+1)
The keyword "odd" will select every other item starting with the first, as will the "2n-1" AND "2n+1" style of code.

7- Given the below HTML, what will p:only-child select, and what will p:only-of-type select?
<section>
        <div>
                <p>I am a paragraph.</p>
        </div>
        <p>I am also a paragraph.</p>
</section>

- Answer: p:only-child will select the 1st paragraph, while p:only-of-type will select both paragraphs.
"p:only-child" is a fit for the first paragraph only. However, "p:only-of-type" fits both paragraphs, because the paragraph is the only of type inside the "div", and it is the only of type inside the "section".

8- Which HTML fragments would match the selector div:empty?
	A.   <div><p></p></div>
	B.   <div></div>
	C.   <div> <!-- a comment --></div>
	D.   <div><!-- a comment --></div>

- Answer: B, D
The fragment in B has nothing in between the "<div>" tags, so this qualifies as empty. The fragment in D has no whitespace around the comment, so this is also considered empty. The whitespace in front of the tag in C and the paragraph tag in A disqualify these options as empty.

9- Given the below HTML, select Paragraph 2.
<section>
        <div>Div 1</div>
        <p>Paragraph 1</p>
        <div>Div 2</div>
        <p>Paragraph 2</p>
        <div>Div 3</div>
</section>

-  Answer: p:last-of-type
This selector selects any paragraph that is the last child of its type. In this case, it selects paragraph 2.

10- Which of these items are pseudo-elements?
	A.   :first-of-type
	B.   :first-child
	C.   :first-letter
	D.   :first-line

- Answer: C, D
":first-letter" and ":first-line" are both pseudo-elements and are occasionally written with a single colon instead of a double colon. They are older pseudo-elements, established in CSS 2.1, before the double colon specification was developed.

11- When writing the pseudo-classes that style link states, what is the correct order these should appear in your stylesheet to ensure a proper cascading effect?

- Answer: 
:link
:visited
:focus
:hover
:active
Remember the mnemonic "Lord Vader Former Handle Anakin" to remember the right order for these pseudo-classes.

12- The :checked pseudo-class applies to the following form elements: 
	A.   radio buttons
	B.   check boxes
	C.   text input
	D.   <option> within a <select> dropdown

- Answer: A, B, D
The ":checked" pseudo-class is associated with elements that can be checked or turned on. This includes radio buttons, check boxes, and the "<option>" tags within a "<select>" dropdown menu.

13- The :required pseudo-class will perform error checking for required fields on a form without the addition of JavaScript.

- Answer: FALSE
The ":required" pseudo-class is helpful for accessibility reasons, but it will not ensure that fields are completed correctly before the form is submitted.
