1- Which is an example of output?

- Answer: saving data to a file
Output is where a program sends data once it has accomplished its work with the data.

2- Why might you display statements for the user indicating when processing starts and when output is complete?

- Answer: if you want to let the user know where in the process the program is when a program takes a long time to run
Without feedback to the user, it can be unclear if a program is still working or has already finished.
